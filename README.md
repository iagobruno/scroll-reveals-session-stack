A page with a stack of sessions, each one revealing itself when the bottom of the page is reached.

When I made this code, I had in mind an article page that automatically loads the next post or a landing page for a online service.

#### Improvement:

When the user uses the scrollbar to go to the bottom of the page and a new item is added, a bug occurs in Firefox.  
In Chrome it doesn't happen.  
Check if this happens on other sites.
